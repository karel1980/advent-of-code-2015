I went maximum lazy for this one and lifted the ubercool game-of-life implementation from from https://github.com/thearn/game-of-life/
Made one small change to avoid the wrap-around (by padding / unpadding before and after the game of life iteration)

Requires matplotlib and numpy (`pip install matplotlib numpy`)
